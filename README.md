[Hacker Rank](https://www.hackerrank.com/dashboard) is a great resource where programmers can learn, practice, and compete in coding challenges. I am not affiliated with Hacker Rank, but I highly recommend checking out the site. It is a great resource and a lot of fun.

This repository is a small collection of solutions for various Hacker Rank challenges I have come across.
